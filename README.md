# qat
Case study reviewing feasibility of training a U-Net based Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically identify and delineate areas of qat agriculture in Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery acquired over central Yemen. Source code developed for this study leverages functionality of the [unet-keras-collection](https://github.com/yingkaisha/keras-unet-collection) library.

Methodology and initial results are presented in a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/chris010970/qat/blob/main/notebooks/predict.ipynb).
